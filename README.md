# Mobattack

> Recent Tower Defense project, born from the ashes of my precedent MOBA learning project.

## What is this Tower Defense thingy

This is a game made with [Unity](https://unity.com/ "Unity homepage").

The basic pitch is that this is a 3D Tower Defense game, with a "hero" character that acts more or less like a MOBA character. Only that the spells have some turret components.

There is not much to show right now. I am building this whole thing live on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/gorlups "gorlups' Twitch channel") pretty much every week day _(in french)_.

### Currently you can

- get in game
- move around
- hit enemies
- get money for it
- use the money to buy turrets
- and try to keep your base alive

### I'm working on

- models and animations
- speeding up attack speed to be coherent with the attack-delay value

### Features planned

- Content _(characters, levels, upgrades, things to unlock)_
- Online Coop
