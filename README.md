# Mobattack

> Tower Defense project, born from the ashes of my precedent MOBA learning project.

## What is this Tower Defense thingy

This is a game made with [Unity](https://unity.com/ "Unity homepage").

The basic pitch is that this is a 3D Tower Defense game, with a "hero" character that acts more or less like a MOBA character. Only that the spells have some turret components.

There is not much to show right now. I'll get some screeshots soon probably.

I tried building this whole thing live on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/gorlups "gorlups' Twitch channel") _(in french)_, but the programmation related stream life wasn't for me. Might try again just playing games sometime.

### Currently you can

- get in game
- look at the pretty cell shaded image on the screen
- move around
- hit skeletts
- get money for it
- use the money to buy turrets
- get XP
- level up and choose upgrades
- and try to keep your base alive

### I'm working on

- Main character level-up upgrades

### Features planned

- Visual effects
- Model variation on upgrades
- Menus
- Content _(characters, levels, upgrades, things to unlock)_
- Online Coop

## Pretty big things already in the game

- Cell shading with outlines
- Stats like damage and armor used on everything

- A main character with an afro that can call his friends from the afro dojo and throw his punches
- About half his level-up upgrades
- Afro students making a wall that punches incoming flying punches
- Afro master using his body as a weapon or projectile

- A normal enemy skelett with several variations
- Another enemy gorilla skelett focusing on punching the player rather than going to the base
- A boss skelett walking slowly and attacking if the player comes close
- All skeletts can be in a stronger variation

## Things in the thing but that will change or be scrapped

- The second character, a bear with guns that can call up wolves and falcons with guns
- A lot of animations
- In-game UI
